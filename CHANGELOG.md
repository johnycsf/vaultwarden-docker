## Unreleased

- Fix root-owned data dirs after compose/restore so host rsync backup/restore works for all users.

- Install can choose **Docker** or **Podman** (`CONTAINER_ENGINE` in `.env`).

- Manage menu includes **Restore** (backup root, snapshot, or archive).

- Single entrypoint: `./manage.sh` (install/update/backup helpers moved under `scripts/`).

- Native ↑/↓ `>` menus in `./manage.sh` (replaced gum/whiptail chooser).

- Optional compressed backup exports (`--archive tar.gz|tar.xz|zip`) with simple password protection; age remains available for strong crypto.

- Install prompts for host ports with conflict detection (keep defaults or choose custom).

- Optional age-encrypted backup exports (`--encrypt`) for offsite disaster recovery.
